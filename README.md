## Bowling challenge without libraries (except chalk)

Based on learnings from the other two times I did the bowling challenge, and also vague rememberings of a Haskell solution I saw once.

### Quick start

```bash
npm install -g yarn # If you don't have yarn
yarn install # to install dependencies using yarn (which I should not have done! boo)
node calculateBowlingScoreSpec.js # to run the tests
```
